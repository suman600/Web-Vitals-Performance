## 📝 TTFB (Time to First Byte) – Quick Notes

---

### 🔹 What is TTFB?

- **TTFB** = **Time to First Byte**
- Measures the time between a user's request and the **first byte of response** from the server.

> It tells how fast the server is **responding** — before any rendering starts.

---

### 🔹 Why TTFB Matters

- TTFB directly affects **FCP, LCP**, and overall perceived speed.
- High TTFB = slow server or network → delays page load start.

---

### 🔹 Good TTFB Score

| Status   | Time       |
|----------|------------|
| ✅ Good   | ≤ 800 ms   |
| ⚠️ Okay   | 800ms–1.8s |
| ❌ Poor   | > 1.8 sec  |

---

### 🔹 What Affects TTFB?

- Slow backend processing (databases, APIs)
- Poor server infrastructure
- No caching (HTML or full page)
- Long network latency
- No CDN or bad geographic distribution

---

### 🔹 How to Reduce TTFB

- Use caching (full-page, server-side, reverse proxy)
- Optimize backend performance (queries, logic)
- Use a CDN to serve content closer to users
- Compress responses (Gzip, Brotli)
- Reduce HTTP redirects
- Avoid cold starts in serverless setups
