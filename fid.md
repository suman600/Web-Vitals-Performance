### 🔹 What is FID?

**FID** stands for **First Input Delay**.  
It measures the time between a user's **first interaction** with a page (like clicking a link or tapping a button) and the time when the browser actually **responds** to that interaction.

> In short: FID shows how quickly a page becomes **interactive**.

---

### 🔹 Why It Matters

- High FID = **slow, unresponsive experience**
- Especially critical on interactive pages (e.g., sign-ups, logins)
- Reflects how long the **main thread** is blocked by scripts

---

### 🔹 FID Performance Benchmarks

| Status   | Time          |
|----------|---------------|
| ✅ Good     | ≤ 100 ms      |
| ⚠️ Needs Improvement   | 100–300 ms    |
| ❌ Poor     | > 300 ms      |

---

### 🔹 What Triggers FID?

- First **click**, **tap**, or **key press** after page load
- **Scroll and zoom** are not measured

---

### 🔹 Common Causes of Poor FID

- Heavy or unoptimized JavaScript
- Long-running tasks (>50ms)
- Render-blocking third-party scripts (ads, analytics)
- Large JS frameworks loading on startup

---

### 🔹 How to Improve FID

- ✅ **Break up long JS tasks** (split into smaller chunks)
- ✅ **Minify and split JavaScript bundles**
- ✅ **Defer or async non-essential scripts**
  ```html
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
  ```
- ✅ **Lazy-load third-party scripts**
- ✅ **Use Web Workers** to handle heavy logic off the main thread

### 🔹 Tools to Measure FID

- **PageSpeed Insights**
- **Chrome DevTools → Performance Tab**
- **Web Vitals Chrome Extension**
- **Google Analytics 4** (for field data)
