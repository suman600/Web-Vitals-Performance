### 🔹 What is FCP?

- Time from page load start to when **first visible content** (text/image) appears.
- Indicates **when users see something happening**.

---

### 🔹 Why It Matters

- Affects **perceived load speed**.
- Faster FCP = better **user experience and engagement**.

### 🔹 Good FCP Score

| Status         | Time           |
|----------------|----------------|
| ✅ Good        | ≤ 1.8 sec      |
| ⚠️ Okay        | 1.8–3 sec      |
| ❌ Poor        | > 3 sec        |
